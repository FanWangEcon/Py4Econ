The work-in-progress [Py4Econ](https://github.com/FanWangEcon/Py4Econ) python examples repository.

Files are written with [RMD](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Materials are gathered from various [projects](https://fanwangecon.github.io/research) in which python code is used for research and paper-administrative tasks. Bullet points show which python packages/functions are used to achieve various objectives. This is not a python package, but a set of example files. The [pyfan](https://pyfan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package repository provides some associated programs.
